# Real-Time Machine Learning for Pollution Reduction and Maximizing Environmental Impact

## Inspiration
With industries becoming increasingly tech-driven, the environmental impact of corporate carbon emissions has grown significantly. ECO2RP was created to help corporates monitor, reduce, and offset their emissions through real-time machine learning. This project aims to promote eco-friendly behaviors among employees while creating a positive environmental footprint.

## Problem Statement
**Environmental Sustainability** is a pressing concern, particularly in industries with high levels of carbon emissions. ECO2RP addresses this by providing a system that calculates, tracks, and reduces corporate carbon emissions in real-time while incentivizing employees and corporations to engage in sustainable practices.

**Objective**: To develop a real-time machine learning system, **ECO2RP**, that helps corporates track, predict, and reduce carbon emissions by assigning personalized tasks and challenges to employees, aiming to offset and minimize their carbon footprint.

## What it does
ECO2RP is a real-time ML model that calculates the carbon emissions produced by corporate organizations. The system tracks individual and organizational carbon output and encourages employees to take eco-friendly actions through gamified challenges. Corporations can also compete to earn an **ECO CORP badge** by consistently reducing their emissions.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Carbon Calculation**: Calculates daily carbon emissions per employee based on hardware and software usage.
- **Employee Engagement**: Motivates employees to reduce emissions by participating in eco-friendly challenges such as carpooling, using public transport, and planting saplings.
- **Corporate Competition**: Corporates can compete to achieve emissions reduction targets and earn the prestigious **ECO CORP badge**.

## Solution Focus Areas

### 1. Predictive Air Quality Management
- Calculates the carbon emissions associated with various corporate hardware and software usage.
- Predicts emissions trends, allowing organizations to make proactive changes to reduce emissions.

### 2. Dynamic Resource Allocation for Environmental Initiatives
- Identifies resources with high emissions and dynamically allocates them more efficiently.
- Predicts carbon output by each resource, enabling companies to make eco-conscious decisions.

### 3. Enhanced Public Awareness and Engagement
- Encourages employees to take eco-friendly actions that reduce their carbon footprint (e.g., carpooling, using public transport, switching to solar energy).
- Awards companies and employees who excel in reducing emissions with the **ECO CORP badge**.
- Promotes a culture of sustainability that extends beyond the workplace and impacts families and communities.

## Model Workflow
1. **Data Collection**:
   - The model collects data on hardware and software usage across corporate departments.
   - Tracks resources like energy consumption and device usage.

2. **Real-Time Carbon Calculation**:
   - Calculates carbon output of each employee and resource in real time using predefined coefficients.

3. **Predictive Analytics**:
   - Predicts future emissions trends to help organizations make proactive environmental decisions.

## How we built it
ECO2RP was developed using machine learning algorithms designed to detect and calculate carbon emissions. We used data from employee activity metrics and hardware usage, processed in real-time, to monitor emissions. Resource allocation algorithms optimize energy consumption, while a gamified platform assigns and tracks eco-challenges for employees.

## Challenges we ran into
- Modeling and analyzing emissions data across diverse corporate activities.
- Integrating real-time data with scalability across various corporate environments.
- Balancing user experience with meaningful environmental metrics.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of creating a real-time ML model that provides corporations with actionable insights into their carbon emissions. ECO2RPâ€™s gamified platform fosters awareness and rewards sustainable practices, making a measurable impact on corporate sustainability.

## What we learned
We learned about the importance of accurate data processing and the complexities involved in real-time carbon monitoring. This project gave us insights into dynamic resource allocation and employee engagement, demonstrating how technology can drive environmental change.

## What's next for ECO2RP
Our next steps include scaling the model to support various industries, enhancing prediction accuracy, and incorporating additional metrics like energy consumption. We plan to expand the eco-challenges platform to encourage broader corporate competition and create a larger global impact.
